  # Valen International


  VALEN INTERNATIONAL is mainly a wine merchant specializing in the import of Spanish wines.


  The president of our company, Mr. German Dorta, is from Venezuela. The company team is made up of a Spanish professional sommelier Daniel Carretero and a group of wine lovers.


  Our vision is to find Spanish quality wineries and quality wines, and introduce to the public in Taiwan. We also hope that our professional sommelier conveys their culture, etiquette and knowledge of wine to Taiwanese friends and more people will know and love Spanish wines!


  The wineries we currently collaborate with are: BODEGA Sommos Garnacha, BODEGA Faustino, Costers Del Si√≥ and BODEGA Zuazo Gaston.
